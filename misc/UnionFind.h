 * @brief From an indexed set of elments, allows fast unioning 
 * of the elements into sets.
 *
 * From a set X={x1,x2,...} (such that |X| = entries), the sets
 * are initialized to Si = {xi}.  Larger sets are created by
 * unioning the set of xi with that of xj using the Union() method.
 *
 * The sets are referenced using unique integer identifiers
 * from 0 to entries-1.
