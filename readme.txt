**** I. Package Contents ****

MotionPlanning/ - motion planning files.
misc/ - miscellaneous support files, including math, graphs, algorithms, etc.
example/ - a sample project that tests a motion planner in a 2d C-space.
COPYING - LGPL copyright notice.
doxygen.conf - Doxygen configuration file.
LMPL.vcproj - Visual studio project file.
Makefile* - GNU Make configuration files.
readme.txt - this readme.
mcr_readme.txt - a readme for setting up minimum constraint removal (MCR)
    problems.

**** II. Usage ****

LMPL source files are designed to be incorporated directly into your project,
or to be built as a shared library.

A typical user of LMPL will subclass the CSpace class and then use a
MotionPlannerFactory to access a motion planner for that space.
Basic multi-modal planning support is currently supported through the
MultiModalCSpace class and the classes defined in MultiModalPlanner.

Using Visual Studio
A Visual Studio project file, LMPL.vcproj, is included with the distribution.
Add this to your solution as needed.  The Doxygen tool can be used to build
documentation, using the doxygen.conf configuration file.

Using GNU make

- 'make' will compile the object files and build a test program in the
  'example' subdirectory. 
- 'make lib' will build the object files into a shared library named 'LMPL.a'.
- If you have the Doxygen tool installed on your system, documentation can be
generated by running 'make docs'.
- 'make all' will build the object files, example, library file, and docs.
