/** @ingroup MotionPlanning
 * @brief Motion planning configuration space base class.
 *
 * An abstract base class defining the C-space interfaces needed for
 * motion planning.  The methods represent a configuration as a
 * vector<double>, but the space may be noneuclidean or not even the
 * same dimensionality as the # of entries in the configuration.
 *
 * The Sample, IsFeasible, and LocalPlanner methods must be overridden
 * by the subclass.  They implicitly define the C-space and free space.
 * Sample MUST have a nonzero chance of succeeding for any of the 
 * motion planning algorithms to work.
 * LocalPlanner will return a new instance of an EdgePlanner
 * (see EdgePlanner.h) depending on the desired type of local planner.
 * 
 * The Distance, Interpolate, and SampleNeighborhood methods
 * are optionally overrideable; the default implementations assume a
 * Euclidean space.  They must be overridden to implement a C-space with
 * a noneuclidean topology.
 *
 * The ObstacleDistance method can be overridden to use the
 * StraightLineObstacleDistancePlanner local planner (note that this has
 * not been thoroughly tested).
